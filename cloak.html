    <p>Here is a mock up from the pattern below.  See how it sits smooth and lays the same way.  Remember, you need to use a thin fabric, preferably loose weave.  This will help shape it over the shoulders

<h3>Material requirements</h3>
Here’s what I worked out based on average height. You’ll need about 4 1/2 yards of 54" to 60” wide material at the most. This includes hood.

It works best with fabric that is not too thick.
<h3>The Cloak</h3>
<img src="https://www.alleycatscratch.com/lotr/Things/FCloak/cloak_small.jpg"> Cut a semicircle with a radius about 10” longer than you want the cloak to be (if you use the full 60” width the straight line will be 120” long).   Remember many of the cloaks are much shorter, stopping at mid calf. 

Add enough around the edges to turn under the hem twice.  So, if it's going to be a 3/4 inch turn, add 1 1/2 inches x 2  or  3" beyond the desired length.
<h3>The Neck hole </h3>The cloak is cut semicircular—but the neck hole is a full circle cut in from the edge.  About two inches in from the center of the front straight edge, cut a hole about 7 inches in diameter (you might need it a little larger—but start small).  Make a cut from the center of the front straight edge to the circle.  Fold the corners of the cut ends up to form a 45 degree angle and cut them off.  You can sew this closed or put in a fastener of some sort—I recommend you reinforce it whichever you do.

Now put it on and decide if you need the center hole for your head to be a bit bigger. 7 inches fit well for me, but rather closely around the neck.  A little trimming goes a long way so take it in small amounts.  You'll also notice that the front of neckline will rise to a point because of the angle of the closure--just trim that to smooth the curve of the neckline.

<i>(If you're really uncomfortable with guessing, make a muslin -- i.e. get an old sheet or another soft cheap piece of fabric, and make it up with the cheap fabric to test your pattern.)</i><br><img src="https://www.alleycatscratch.com/lotr/Things/FCloak/Neckhole_small.jpg">
<h3>The Hood</h3>
<h5>Making the Pattern</h5>
The standard hood, consisting of two squares sewn together, just doesn’t hang down far enough. I’ve come up with a pattern that works, even though it looks a little strange.

You’ll need to make a pattern, so get a big sheet of paper or tape together some newspapers.  
<ol>
<li>Measure the neckline hole of your cloak. (Circumference)</li>
 <li>Divide this in half, then add 1 inch (for seam allowance).</li> 
<li>Draw a horizontal line that long. </li>
<li>Draw a line from one end straight down for about 30”, then connect the bottom of that line to the end of your horizontal line.</li>
 <strong>You’ve made a tall thin right triangle. </strong><img src="https://www.alleycatscratch.com/lotr/Things/FCloak/hood_pattern_small.jpg">
<li>Fold it along the diagonal line and then cut it out—you’ll have a kite-shaped piece. </li>
<li>Cut four of these from your cloth (two for the hood, two for the lining).</li><img src="https://www.alleycatscratch.com/lotr/Things/FCloak/hood_pattern_II_small.jpg">
 <i>When you cut them out, align one of the straight edges of the “kite” with the grain line of the fabric (see arrow) —otherwise the hood won’t drape correctly.</i>
 </ol>
 <h5>Putting the hood together</h5>
 The top is 1/2 the final cloak neck edge measurement plus 1 inch.  The length of the straight side should be about 30 inches (or 3-4 inches longer than you want the finished hood to be).  Cut four pieces—two for the hood, two for the lining.

 Lay one “kite” on top of another, right sides together, and sew together along the long sides.  Repeat for the other two “kites.”<img src="https://www.alleycatscratch.com/lotr/Things/FCloak/hood_pattern_III_small.jpg">

 Now if you take the two points at the top of the kite and pull them apart, the hood will refold into a triangle with the seams running up the center of the front and back.<img src="https://www.alleycatscratch.com/lotr/Things/FCloak/hood_patterh_IV_small.jpg">

(Doesn't that shape look familiar?)

You need to check this with a quick muslin to check the hood..  Is this shape wide enough to wear with the hood up.  It is for some, others need to go an extra step.  If the opening is too small... you next to make one more change to your pattern... and follow a slightly different set of sewing instructions.

If you want a wider cloak hood, follow the next section, else skip to Stitching it to the Neck

<br><strong>If you want a wider cloak hood: </strong><br>
With the pattern as shown, if the distance around the neck hole is small it's not surprising you couldn't get the hood over your head. The length of the front of the hood is the same as the distance around the neck hole, since the kite is symmetrical.

What you need to do is to measure the distance from where the cloak opening (under your chin) will be, loosely up the side of your face, to where you want the hood to rest at the top. If this is very much longer than half the circumference of the neck hole, you will need to draw a kite with a flat curve across the top instead of an angle. The length of the curve should be the sum of half the circumference of the neck hole and the 'hood height' measurement you just took. Be sure it doesn't curve _too_ much.

At this point, as we all know, Muslin Is A Very Good Thing.

Sew the long sides of the kite pairs together and refold the hood as shown in the main instructions. Starting from the seam which will attach to the neck hole, measure one half the neck-hole measurement in each direction.

Machine stitch the lining to the outer hood from one of these points to the _other_ seam and around to the second point you just marked.

Leave the rest of the lining free. Turn the lining to the inside.

Keeping the lining out of the way, now sew the unsewn edge of the outer fabric to the neck hole,  (ie, the seam is at the center-back of the neck). It should match if you measured those two points correctly. Finally, turn in the remaining edge of the lining and hand-stitch it over the neck seam, hiding the seam allowances.
<h3>Stitching it to the Neck</h3>
Now you have to sew the two hoods together.  Time to pick your outer side and your lining side.  (Which you pick shouldn't matter, we just need to refer to them separately. 

Lay the cloak down, right side of the fabric up.  Mark the dead center back of the circle.  This mark will match up with the center seam of the outer hood piece.  Lay the hood down, right side of the fabric, to the right side of the hood.

Pin from the center out to each of the sides.  This will take a little easing since you are matching straight  line of hood to the curve of the neck. (See picture you're pinning the dashed lines together. )  You will need to push the lining piece out of the way as you get near the front edge. (Don't sew the lining piece... leave it free.) 

Leave enough open to turn under the front edge and finish it later.  (It's helpful to mark that point with pins or chalk so you don't sew past it.)

Sew together. 

The hood lining is ready to be tacked down.  Turn under the seam allowance of the second layer and hand stitch it over the raw edges of the seam for a beautifully clean finish.

Note: this does make a very small hood in front... but if you've seen them wearing them up, that's what they look like.
